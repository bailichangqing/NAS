4/17 function create_seq find_my_seed randlc from IS are done.
4/18 function full_verify is translated, but has not been tested. operations on arrays may cause problems.

5/10 TODO: test MPI.Reduce using mutable and immutable input
           c_print_results function
           complete main function
           review array operations

5/15 key_buff2 is used to receive keys using MPI.Alltoallv(). In julia receive buffer is created automatically.
     The problem is real size of the buffer could be smaller than the size declared in C language. In order to
     run the program, I use a key_buff2buf to store keys got from MPI.Alltoallv and then copy the elements of it
     into key_buff2. For performance, I should check whether I can directly use key_buff2 to receive keys from
     MPI.Alltoallv()

     timeron need to be broadcast by process 0. So in main function, timeron is declared as global
